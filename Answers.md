## Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.
A relational database stores data in tables grouped into rows and columns, represented as relations. Most databases support Structured Query Language (SQL) in order to retrieve data and perform other operations on the database.

## Why do tables need a `primary key`?
Each row in a table must have a primary key to uniquely identify that row.

## What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
A foreign key references the primary key on another table.

## What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
A junction table is required to have a many-to-many relationship between two tables.
